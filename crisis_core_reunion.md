# Walkthrough

This game was a lot of fun, but the guides I read required grinding for hours or lots of skill.

You can follow this guide and beat the game in about 2.5 hrs.

If you want to get all the achievements it's a good idea to make a new save for each chapter.

## General info
- The game is very linear, just kill the enemies along the way and follow the objective indicator. 
- You can click on the left stick to sprint.
- You can run from battles you don't want to fight by going to an edge of the area.
- Saves heal your health when you walk over them.
- When not in combat you can open your menu and buy supplies from the shop.
- Potions heal health, ethers heal magic, soma heals SP points, remedy curies ailments.
- Other shops can be opened as you progress very far in missions
- Yellow materia uses SP, green materia uses magic.
- You can use items both in and out of battle.
- You will use a ton of items in this game, so don't be afraid to use and buy them.
- Item chests are generally not important so don't stress about finding them all.
- Running to the side of hallway may prevent some battles, there are random battles.
- If you die you don't lose items, it reloads the save, teleports you to the fight and you can retry without penalty.

# Chapter 0
- The game does a good job of explaining the battle mechanics, pay attention.
- All talking and cutscenes can be skipped by pressing start.
- You have high level magic they take away when you finish this chapter
- Behemoth Fight: Use A to dodge to the back legs, spam attack until dead

- Go to the save
- Do the first training mission 1-1-1, spam X
- Get the item from the box. 
- Talk to the box 20 times to get the cursed ring and equip it

The cursed ring delays level ups, but gives you a large stat boost.

- Answer "I'm coming Angeal"
- Boss: dodge, spam blizzard
- Don't do mission 8-1-1

- Run around until you find a magic pot, use the materia it says in order, this unlocks the Item Mugger DMW
- Trade curse ring for bronze bangle
- Run from battles until you get two tonberries in the corridor, the first or second DMV will be Item Mugger
- You want either a 3 or 5 Gold Pins, forfeit and retry until you do (1/10 chance or so)
- Wait for more Item Muggers
- When Zach is level 10 and you are tired of grinding, kill the tonberry, and finish the mission to save your experience

## Optional
- Do mission 6-1-6, use fira
- Do mission 6-3-1, poison dual horn, fira scarabs, run around and attack back
